fire detection code explanation

This code is a simple fire detection system using OpenCV, Pygame for audio alerting, and smtplib for sending email alerts. The program captures video from a webcam and detects fire in the video frames using a pre-trained cascade classifier. If fire is detected, it triggers an alarm sound and sends an email alert.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

Libraries Used:

cv2 (OpenCV): Used for computer vision tasks, image processing, and video capture.
threading: Used for creating and managing threads for concurrent execution.
pygame: Used for playing alarm sounds.
smtplib: Used for sending email alerts.
email.mime.text and email.mime.multipart: Used for constructing email messages.
Cascade Classifier for Fire Detection:

The code uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier for fire detection. The classifier model is loaded using cv2.CascadeClassifier('fire_detection_cascade_model.xml').
The fire detection is performed using fire_cascade.detectMultiScale(frame, 1.2, 5), which returns the coordinates (x, y, w, h) of detected fire regions in the frame.
Functions for Alerting:

play_alarm_sound_function(): Uses Pygame to play a fire alarm sound. It's executed in a separate thread to allow concurrent execution with other parts of the code.
send_mail_function(): Sends an email alert about the fire incident. It's executed in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main program.
Main Loop:

The program continuously captures frames from the webcam using vid.read().
Converts each frame to grayscale for fire detection.
Detects fire in the frame using the cascade classifier.
If fire is detected, it draws rectangles around the detected fire regions and initiates the alarm sound and email alert.
The Pygame mixer is used to play the alarm sound in a non-blocking way.
The send_mail_function is called only once (controlled by the runOnce flag) when fire is first detected.
Pressing 'q' in the OpenCV window stops the program, stopping the alarm sound and closing the video feed.
Output:

When a fire is detected in the webcam feed, rectangles are drawn around the detected fire regions, and the alarm sound is played. Additionally, an email alert is sent.
The program continues to run until the user presses 'q', at which point it stops the Pygame mixer, quits the program, and closes the video feed.
