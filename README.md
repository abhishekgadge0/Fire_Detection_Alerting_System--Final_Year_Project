# Fire Detection and Alerting System

## Introduction
This project was completed as an academic requirement of my final year. It features a real-time fire detection system that uses the Haar Cascade algorithm to identify fire and automatically sends alert messages via email. The system aims to enhance fire safety by providing timely notifications of fire incidents.

## Project Goals
- **Real-Time Fire Detection:** Utilize computer vision techniques to detect fire in real-time using a camera feed.
- **Automatic Alerting:** Implement an automated system to send alert messages to designated email addresses when fire is detected.
- **Algorithm Utilization:** Leverage the Haar Cascade algorithm for effective fire detection.

## Methodology
- **Face Detection with Haar Cascade:** Employ the Haar Cascade algorithm to identify fire-related features in video frames.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the camera feed for signs of fire.
- **Alert System Integration:** Integrate an email service to send automated alert messages when fire is detected.
- **System Testing:** Ensure the system's accuracy and reliability through extensive testing.

## Dependencies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Email libraries (e.g., smtplib)

## Technologies Used
- **Haar Cascade Algorithm:** Used for detecting fire features in video frames.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Enables continuous monitoring and immediate response to fire detection.
- **Email Alert System:** Sends notifications via email when fire is detected.

## Contribution
This project is intended to improve fire safety by providing early warnings of potential fire hazards. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome!

Letâ€™s work together to enhance fire detection systems and improve safety measures.
